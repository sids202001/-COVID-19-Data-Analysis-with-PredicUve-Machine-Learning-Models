# -COVID-19-Data-Analysis-with-Predictive-Machine-Learning-Model

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and predicting various COVID-19 metrics using a comprehensive dataset. Our primary focus is on confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates across different countries and regions, utilizing advanced data science techniques and machine learning models to provide insights and forecasts.

## Features of the Project

### Data Handling
- **Import, clean, and preprocess data** to prepare it for analysis. This includes:
  - Handling missing values
  - Detecting duplicates
  - Managing data types

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform an in-depth analysis using statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the distribution and correlation of data, focusing on COVID-19 metrics like confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

### Statistical Analysis
- Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- Compute more complex indicators like death and recovery rates.

### Data Visualization
- Utilize **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to create a variety of charts, including:
  - Histograms
  - Bar charts
  - Box plots
  - Scatter plots
  - Choropleth maps

### Predictive Modeling
- Use machine learning models like **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **XGBoost** to predict COVID-19 outcomes based on historical data.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Conduct binary classification to categorize data based on specified thresholds.

### Model Evaluation
- Assess the accuracy and efficiency of the predictive models and visualize the relationship between actual and predicted values.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive graphs.
- **Sklearn**: For machine learning models and performance metrics.
- **XGBoost**: For an efficient implementation of the Gradient Boosting framework.
- **Google Colab**: Chosen as the development environment for its seamless integration with Google Drive, facilitating easy data management and sharing.

## Project Goals
- **Insightful Data Analysis**: To uncover underlying patterns and correlations between different COVID-19 metrics across countries.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: To develop reliable models capable of forecasting future trends based on available data.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: To create dynamic and interactive plots that facilitate a better understanding and presentation of the data.
